    steps:
    # Step 1: Checkout the code
    - name: Checkout repository
      uses: actions/checkout@v2

    # Step 2: Set up PHP (with necessary extensions)
    - name: Set up PHP
      uses: shivammathur/setup-php@v2
      with:
        php-version: '8.2'
        extensions: mbstring, intl, bcmath  # Optional: Add other extensions if needed

    # Step 3: Install Composer globally (ensure it's available for the current workflow)
    - name: Install Composer globally
      run: curl -sS https://getcomposer.org/installer | php -- --install-dir=/usr/local/bin --filename=composer

    # Step 4: Install Composer dependencies (including PHPUnit and PHPCS)
    - name: Install Composer dependencies
      run: composer install --no-progress --prefer-dist --verbose

    # Step 5: Install PHP_CodeSniffer (PHPCS)
    - name: Install PHP_CodeSniffer (PHPCS)
      run: composer require --dev squizlabs/php_codesniffer

    # Step 6: Set execute permissions for PHPCS (to avoid permission issues)
    - name: Set execute permissions for PHPCS
      run: chmod +x vendor/bin/phpcs

    # Step 7: Verify PHPCS installation
    - name: Verify PHPCS installation
      run: vendor/bin/phpcs --version  # This will confirm if PHPCS is correctly installed

    # Step 8: List directory structure to debug paths (optional)
    - name: List directory structure
      run: ls -R  # This helps to check if 'src/' exists or find the correct path

    # Step 9: Run PHPCS for linting (adjust path based on actual folder)
    - name: Run PHPCS for linting
      run: vendor/bin/phpcs --standard=PSR12 demo_project_cicd/  # Adjust this path if necessary

    # Step 10: Set execute permissions for PHPUnit (to ensure it's executable)
    - name: Set execute permissions for PHPUnit
      run: chmod +x vendor/bin/phpunit

    # Step 11: Verify PHPUnit installation
    - name: Verify PHPUnit installation
      run: vendor/bin/phpunit --version  # This will confirm if PHPUnit is correctly installed

    # Step 12: Run PHPUnit tests
    - name: Run PHPUnit tests
      run: vendor/bin/phpunit --configuration phpunit.xml
